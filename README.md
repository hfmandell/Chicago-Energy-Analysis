# Chicago-Energy-Analysis

 This program displays control over csv file usage, matplotlib, and function creation to better understand numerical
 data within large data files. More specifically, this program analyzes Chicago csvs of KWH energy usage and
 determines whether, on average, more energy is used in the winter months or the summer months and creates a scatter
 plot of Month of the Year v. Average Energy Usage. This program also analyzes Chicago csvs of socioeconomic factors
 and residential building energy usage and attempts to find a correlation by drawing a scatter plot of
 Average Community Income vs. Personal Energy Consumption (kw/person/year)
